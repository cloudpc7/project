# SIMON
[Simon](https://cloudpc7.github.io/project/)

>Simon is a game where the fun never stops and you must succeed at memorizing the next color in order to achieve the next level. What level can you get up to is up to you. Can you win or will you just keep on playing?!

### HTML
* The HTML is pretty simple it uses a body completed with a title then a div with four buttons styled with id's inside. 

### CSS
* The Css was created by using _flexbox_.
* Each button is styled with two different lights one for the original board and one for the flash.
* items are centered to display in the middle of the screen for readability and functionality. 

### PsuedoCode
* The PsuedoCode is created to provide instructions on how the Simon game was designed.
* The game is developed by using the [Guide to Building a Browser Game](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/6f1919291f6007b2c0b2c93d925d6bac) and help with the _Browser Game App Flow_.

### Javascript

* Following the guide I created constants, state variables, cached variables, eventListeners, and the initializer.
