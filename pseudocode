1. Define required constant:
  1.1)Create an object that holds the 4 buttons on the board that is color coded. 
  1.2 Create a randomized array that pushes a sequence of numbers that the computer will hold. 
  1.3)Create an empty array for the player when the player tries to react to the computer sequence and match. 
  1.4)Create a timing function that will hold null while the computer is outputing a sequence.

2. Define required variables used to track the state of the game:
    2.1 Create a timing function that let's you know when it is the player's turn.
    2.2 Create a computer object for sequence of colors. 
    2.3 Create a player object for sequence of colors that is clicked on. 
3. Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code.
    3.1 create 4 elements for each color sequence(blue,yellow,red,green);
    3.2 create start button;
    3.3 create a reset button;
4. Create an init function that initializes the state variables;
    4.1 Initialize the start button
    4.2 Initialize the timer. 
    4.3 Initialize the computer sequence.
    4.4 Initialize a function that create a null value while computer is providing  a sequence so player cannot interrupt. 
5. Render those state variables to the page
    5.1 Render the start button, reset button.
    5.2 Render the computer sequence to the page
    5.3 Render the player sequence after the computer sequence finishes.
