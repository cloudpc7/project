1. Define required constant:
  1.1)Create an object that holds 4 key value pairs for each color on the board.
 

2. Define required variables used to track the state of the game:
    2.1 Create an object for computer sequence
    2.2 Create an object for player sequence
    2.3  Create a timer
    2.4 Create a start 
    2.5 create a reset
3. Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code.
    3.1 cached element reference for computer sequence
    3.2 cached element reference for player sequence
    3.3 Create an event listener for when player clicks the start button.
    3.4 Create an event listener for after player clicks or finishes the sequence after computer sequence. 
    3.5 Create an event listener for the reset button.
    3.6 If the player clicks reset button then the computer sequence variable needs to be set to empty. 
    3.7 if the player clicks the start button provide an even that sets a small timer until computer starts its sequence
    3.8 Once the computer sets the sequence  apply a function that holds the value  while the computer is running a sequence. 
    3.9 provide a 5 second delay inbetween computer sequence and player sequence. 
4. Create an init function that initializes the state variables;
    4.1 Initialize the start button
    4.2 Initialize the timer. 
    4.3 Initialize the computer sequence.
    4.4 Initialize a function that create a null value while computer is providing  a sequence so player cannot interrupt. 
5. Render those state variables to the page
    5.1 Render the start button, reset button.
    5.2 Render the computer sequence to the page
    5.3 Render the player sequence after the computer sequence finishes.
